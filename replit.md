# replit.md

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with React, TypeScript, and Express.js that provides an API marketplace management system. The application allows administrators to manage external APIs, services, keys, and orders while providing a client interface for key validation and order management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and build processes

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Architecture**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **APIs**: External API providers with authentication keys
- **Services**: Individual services offered by APIs (followers, likes, etc.)
- **Keys**: Generated access keys for clients
- **Orders**: Client orders for services

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based authentication using express-session
- PostgreSQL session store via connect-pg-simple
- No complex user management - simplified admin/client model

### API Integration
- Abstracted storage layer supporting multiple external APIs
- Service synchronization from external providers
- Order processing and status tracking

## Data Flow

1. **Admin Flow**: 
   - Add/manage external API connections
   - Sync services from external APIs
   - Generate and manage client keys
   - Monitor orders and system status

2. **Client Flow**:
   - Validate access keys
   - Place orders for services
   - Track order status

3. **System Flow**:
   - External API integration for service data
   - Order processing and fulfillment
   - Real-time status updates

## External Dependencies
